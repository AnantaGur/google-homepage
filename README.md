GOOGLE HOMEPAGE CLONE

This project is to create a html/css clone of the google homepage without its javascript functionality.
Later on JS may be added but for now it is just a dead page to practice on and get in the habbit of using
git and github with other projects. 

There will be a self reflection once the project is finished.
